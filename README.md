# Vaxi Babu

**Vaxi Babu** is a cinematic, voice-first health memory system built to help families remember, understand, and act on essential preventive healthcare tasks such as vaccinations, routine checkups, and medicine-safety checks.

The project is designed for low-access and low-literacy contexts, where healthcare actions are often missed not because of negligence, but because of fragmented records, weak reminder systems, limited digital literacy, and lack of simple guidance.

---

## 🌟 Vision

Vaxi Babu acts like a high-performance family health memory assistant.

Instead of expecting users to manually track medical schedules, it provides a **premium, interactive experience** that:

- **Generates a Deterministic Health Timeline** from basic profile data (based on India's National Immunization Schedule).
- **Uses Dynamic Voice Context** to allow families to talk to their data naturally.
- **Provides Multi-Language Support** across 7+ regional Indian languages.
- **Delivers Medicine Safety Double-Checks** via simple image uploads and structured caution logic.
- **Works Offline-First** ensuring reliability in real-world scenarios with unstable connectivity.
- **Enables Vaccination Verification** with ASHA worker verification and document uploads.
- **Manages Reminders** for upcoming health events with customizable notifications.
