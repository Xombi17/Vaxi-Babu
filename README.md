# WellSync AI

**WellSync AI** is a voice-first health memory system built to help families remember, understand, and act on essential preventive healthcare tasks such as vaccinations, routine checkups, and medicine-safety checks.

The project is designed for low-access and low-literacy contexts, where healthcare actions are often missed not because of negligence, but because of fragmented records, weak reminder systems, limited digital literacy, and lack of simple guidance.

---

## Vision

WellSync AI acts like a family health memory assistant.

Instead of expecting users to manually track medical schedules, it helps them by:

- Generating a health timeline from basic profile data (based on India's National Immunization Schedule)
- Highlighting upcoming and overdue health actions
- Explaining what each health action means in simple language
- Supporting live voice interaction via Vapi AI
- Providing medicine safety double-checking through image upload and structured caution logic
- Working toward offline-first usability for real-world low-connectivity scenarios

---

## Problem We Are Solving

In many communities, families miss important healthcare actions such as:

- Child vaccination doses
- Pregnancy-related checkups
- Preventive follow-ups
- Safe medicine usage during pregnancy or illness

This happens because:

- Health records are fragmented
- Caregivers may not remember schedules
- Existing solutions often assume high literacy
- Many interfaces are too text-heavy
- People sometimes self-medicate without understanding risks

WellSync AI is being built to solve this with a structured, voice-first, easy-to-understand experience.

## Core Features

### 1. Health Timeline Generation
- Create household and dependent profiles
- Generate vaccination and preventive health timelines based on the India NIS (National Immunization Schedule)
- Mark events as `upcoming`, `due`, `overdue`, or `completed`
- Deterministic engine with versioned schedule output

### 2. Voice-First Assistance
- Live voice interaction for asking health-related timeline questions
- Simple spoken guidance for users with limited literacy
- Voice agent support via Vapi AI webhooks

### 3. Health Action Explanations
- Explain what a vaccine, checkup, or reminder is for
- Keep explanations short, simple, and understandable
- Groq LLM used only for simplification and communication, not for medical decision-making
- Automatic fallback to static templates if AI call fails

### 4. Medicine Safety Checker
- Upload a photo of a medicine strip, medicine box, or printed prescription
- Extract medicine details using Gemma 4 (via Ollama) with Llama 3.2 Vision fallback and Google Cloud Vision as last resort
- Check for common side effects, important cautions, and pregnancy-related warnings
- Return a safe, simplified caution-oriented response bucketted into: `common_use`, `use_with_caution`, `insufficient_information`, `consult_doctor_urgently`

### 5. Offline-First Readiness
- Cache key application screens
- Store important user and timeline data locally
- Support gradual sync when connectivity returns

- React Hook Form
- Zod
- PWA support
- IndexedDB + Dexie

### Backend (Implemented)
- **FastAPI** with async/await throughout
- **Python 3.11+**
- **SQLModel** (SQLAlchemy + Pydantic) for typed ORM models
- **asyncpg** for async Postgres driver
- **Alembic** for database migrations

- **Google Cloud Vision** as optional 3rd-tier OCR fallback
- **Pydantic Settings** for typed config management
- **structlog** for structured logging
- **httpx** for async HTTP calls
- Custom deterministic health schedule engine (India NIS rules)

### Database
- **Neon serverless Postgres** — async `asyncpg` driver
- **SQLModel** as ORM (replaces Prisma for backend-only schema ownership)
- Schema: `households`, `dependents`, `health_events`, `reminders`

### AI / Voice
- **Groq API** — health event explanations, voice Q&A, medicine result simplification
- **Vapi AI** — live voice agent orchestration (webhook integration)
- **Ollama (Gemma 4 + Llama 3.2 Vision)** — local OCR for medicine packaging
- **Google Cloud Vision** — optional hosted OCR fallback
- Deterministic rule-based health and medicine safety logic (AI never decides safety)

### Tooling
- `uv` / `pip` for Python dependency management
- `pyproject.toml` with `hatchling` build backend
- `ruff` for linting and formatting
- `mypy` for optional static typing
- `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio` for backend testing

### Deployment
- Vercel for frontend
- Railway / Render for backend
- Neon for database hosting

## Development Principles

- **Voice first, not voice only**
- **Deterministic health logic first** — the LLM never decides schedules or medicine safety
- **AI for explanation, not diagnosis**
- **Keep the interface simple**
- **Prefer safe, conservative medical messaging**
- **Document every major architectural decision**
- **Avoid context loss across AI sessions**
- **Use the PRD as the source of truth**

---

## Rules for AI Agents

All AI agents working in this repository must follow these rules:

1. Read the PRD (`PRD.md`) before making changes
2. Do not start coding without understanding the current architecture
3. Do not change the tech stack unless explicitly approved in the PRD
4. Do not work in conflicting parallel sessions on the same area
5. Update documentation when major changes are made
6. Prefer small, scoped changes over broad rewrites
7. Reuse existing context instead of re-deriving it every session

The goal is to reduce conflicts, save tokens, and keep the project coherent.

---

## Safety Principles

WellSync AI is **not** a diagnostic medical system.

The application must never:
- Diagnose disease
- Guarantee medicine safety
- Replace a doctor, pharmacist, or healthcare worker
- Invent vaccine schedules or medical guidance

The application may:
- Help users remember preventive care
- Explain health actions in simple language
- Surface medicine cautions and risk signals
- Encourage users to consult professionals when necessary

---
